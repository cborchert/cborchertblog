description: 'An quick introduction to the blog and its purposes'

Hi there, my name is Chris, and I'd like to write more often, and especially to write more about the things that I learn during my career as a javascript developer.

While this blog might evolve into a more ambitious project, for the moment it's just for me. I find that summarizing what I've learned by writing about it, making idealized examples of a problem, describing the problem, and so on solidifies my learning. That said, I don't claim to be an especially good writer or teacher. I'd love it if what I write here could help someone learn something, but, at the moment, I'm not writing for an audience, I'm not writing on a schedule, and I'm mostly writing as a supplemental exercise to my own learning.

Complete disclosure: I've started a few projects like this over the years, and they've never taken off. Case in point, the earliest commits to this blog date to July 2017, but this is the first article that I'll be publishing (and that is only because the blog needs some content not to have a blank homepage). Here's to sticking to it this time.
